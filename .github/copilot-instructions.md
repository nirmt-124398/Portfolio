# Project Instructions — Read Before Writing Code or Content

## 1. What This Project Is

This project is a **personal product website**, not a traditional portfolio.

It represents a **technical founder-style profile** for Nirmit, built to:
- Convert startup founders and early-stage entrepreneurs
- Communicate clarity, systems thinking, and execution ability
- Feel calm, trustworthy, and YC (Y Combinator) inspired

This site should feel like:
> “A builder who understands products, not a freelancer selling services.”

---

## 2. Target Audience (Very Important)

Primary audience:
- Startup founders
- Early-stage entrepreneurs
- Technical and non-technical founders
- People building or scaling products

Secondary audience:
- Recruiters for high-impact product or engineering roles

This audience:
- Dislikes marketing buzzwords
- Prefers plain English
- Values clarity, reliability, and outcomes
- Trusts calm confidence over flashy design

---

## 3. Core Philosophy (YC Style)

This site follows **Y Combinator-style principles**:

- Clarity > cleverness
- Simple > impressive
- Honest > polished
- Outcomes > features
- Systems > tools

Avoid:
- Hype
- Buzzwords
- Exaggerated claims
- Marketing language
- Decorative UI elements

Prefer:
- Short sentences
- Plain English
- Direct explanations
- Calm, confident tone

If something feels “cool but unnecessary”, do NOT include it.

---

## 4. What This Site Is NOT

- Not a design showcase
- Not a flashy agency website
- Not a resume dump
- Not a personal blog
- Not influencer-style branding

No:
- Lorem ipsum
- Fake testimonials
- Overly emotional copy
- “Passionate about…” statements
- Claims without evidence

---

## 5. Content Rules (Critical for Copilot)

When generating text content:

### ✅ DO
- Write real, meaningful placeholder content
- Explain what problems are solved
- Use neutral, professional language
- Focus on usefulness and intent
- Assume a smart, busy reader

### ❌ DO NOT
- Use lorem ipsum
- Use generic filler text
- Use exaggerated adjectives
- Use marketing buzzwords (e.g. “cutting-edge”, “next-gen”)
- Use emojis or casual slang

Example of GOOD copy:
> “I help startups build reliable digital systems that are easy to maintain and scale.”

Example of BAD copy:
> “I am passionate about building innovative, cutting-edge solutions.”

---

## 6. SEO Intent (Without Marketing Noise)

SEO should be **natural and honest**, not forced.

Content should naturally include phrases like:
- startup developer
- product-focused engineer
- scalable systems
- backend and infrastructure
- design systems
- automation and data
- founder support
- early-stage startups

SEO goal:
- Be discoverable by founders looking for someone to **build or stabilize products**
- Not to rank for generic “web developer” keywords

Never stuff keywords.
Never repeat phrases unnaturally.

---

## 7. Design & UI Methodology

Design follows a **design-system-first approach**:

- Dark theme
- Grayscale-first (color is optional and user-triggered)
- One accent color only
- Minimal, calm UI
- Strong spacing and typography hierarchy

UI principles:
- No gradients
- No decorative icons
- No unnecessary animations
- No visual noise

If the layout works in grayscale, it is correct.

---

## 8. Architecture Principles

This project uses:
- Next.js (App Router)
- JSX (not TypeScript)
- Tailwind CSS
- Component-based architecture

Core architectural ideas:
- Small, reusable components
- Clear separation between layout, sections, and primitives
- Boring, predictable structure
- No clever abstractions

Components should be:
- Readable
- Explicit
- Easy to modify later

---

## 9. Page Structure (Single-Page First)

Initial structure is a **single-page site** with these sections:

1. Hero — value and positioning
2. Capabilities — what problems are solved
3. How I Work — process and thinking
4. Proof / Experience — credibility
5. About — brief human context
6. CTA — direct contact invitation

Do not add extra pages unless explicitly instructed.

---

## 10. CTA & Conversion Rules

- One primary CTA only
- Clear and direct language
- No pressure tactics
- No fake urgency

Example CTA:
> “If you’re building something and need help with execution or systems, feel free to reach out.”

---

## 11. Future Enhancements (Context Only)

Later, this site may include:
- A user-controlled color reveal mode
- Subtle cinematic transitions
- Additional case studies or writing

Do NOT preemptively design for these.
Build clean foundations first.

---

## 12. Final Instruction to Copilot

When in doubt:
- Choose clarity over creativity
- Choose boring over flashy
- Choose honest over impressive

This site should make founders think:
> “This person understands how real products are built.”
